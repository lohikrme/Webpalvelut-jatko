          Data is sent via POST http request to '/exampleapp/new_note' endpoint.
          There apparently is a separate backend software running elsewhere.
          One of its endpoints is the POST '/exampleapp/newnote' endpoint, 
          which receives data from the form below.
          The other endpoint is the GET '/exampleapp/data.json',
          which is not visible inside this html file, but used by the main.js file.
